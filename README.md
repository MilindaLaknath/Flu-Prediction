# Flu-Prediction
Predicting Future Flu Virus Strains with Machine Learning 
These programs predict future influenza virus strains. The prediction output is a list of floats. Each number in the float corresponds to a base pair:
A to 1, T to 2, G to 3, and C to 4.

To use:
Input any HA (hemagglutinin) or NA (neuraminidase) flu protein sequence into the program and it will output a predicted offspring of that specific flu strain.
